* 2x screws and nuts to attach to EQ5 legs (these are already on the EQ5)

* 1x 5mm coupler. I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GMW7T2D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but you might be able to use other flexible couplers

* 1x Teflon sheet [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0195H6JTY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You'll cut two rings from this.
* Synthetic grease to lubricate between the two Teflon rings
